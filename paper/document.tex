\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In this groundbreaking investigation, we explore a striking and absolutely questionable correlation between the number of Master's degrees awarded in Mathematics and Statistics, and the frequency of Google searches for the phrase ``why do I have a migraine'' from 2012 to 2021. While the relationship is likely spurious, the implications for public health, education, and the cosmic balance of the universe are clearly profound.
\end{abstract}

\begin{section}{Introduction}
 Correlations are everywhere---sometimes meaningful, other times hilariously coincidental. Inspired by the timeless wisdom of tylervigen.com, we delved into a curious trend: as the number of Master's degrees awarded in Mathematics and Statistics increases, so too does public interest in migraines, as measured by Google search queries \cite{vigen}.
\end{section}

\begin{section}{Data and Methods}
 We utilized data featured by Tyler Vigen, drawn from publicly available sources:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Master's degrees awarded in Mathematics and Statistics}: National Center for Education Statistics. \cite{nc_es}
   \item \textbf{Google searches for ``why do I have a migraine''}: Google Trends. \cite{google_trends}
 \end{itemize}
 The analysis covered the years 2012 through 2021. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to measure the linear relationship, yielding a stunning correlation of $r =$ \input{generated/correlation_value.tex}, with $r^2 =$ \input{generated/r_squared_value.tex} and $p$-value of \input{generated/p_value.tex}.

 We also performed a normalized linear regression analysis to quantify the relationship between the two variables. The estimated slope for the number of Master's degrees awarded in Mathematics and Statistics is \input{generated/nces_slope_value.tex}, while the slope for Google searches for ``why do I have a migraine'' is \input{generated/google_slope_value.tex}. These slopes represent the average change in each variable per unit increase in the other, after normalization.

 To further probe the dynamics of the relationship, we also computed the year-over-year changes in both datasets. This first-difference analysis captures how annual fluctuations in math degrees and migraine-related searches align. The correlation between these yearly changes resulted in $r =$ \input{generated/yearly_changes_correlation_value.tex}, $r^2 =$ \input{generated/yearly_changes_r_squared_value.tex}, and a $p$-value of \input{generated/yearly_changes_p_value.tex}.

\begin{section}{Results}
 The correlation coefficient of \input{generated/correlation_value.tex} suggests an almost comically strong linear relationship. Approximately \input{generated/r_squared_percentage_value.tex} of the variation in migraine search frequency could be ``explained'' by math degree trends. The data paints a picture of synchronized suffering.

   \label{fig:correlation}
 \end{figure}

 The normalized linear regression analysis yielded the following estimated slopes: \input{generated/nces_slope_value.tex} for the number of Master's degrees awarded in Mathematics and Statistics, and \input{generated/google_slope_value.tex} for Google searches for ``why do I have a migraine''. These slopes indicate that, on average, a one standard deviation increase in one variable is associated with an increase of approximately \input{generated/google_slope_value.tex} (for Google searches) or \input{generated/nces_slope_value.tex} (for degrees) standard deviations in the other variable, after normalization. This quantifies the strength of the association observed in the data.

 \end{figure}

 Additionally, the analysis of yearly changes reveals a much weaker relationship. The correlation drops to \input{generated/yearly_changes_correlation_value.tex}, with $r^2 =$ \input{generated/yearly_changes_r_squared_value.tex} (just \input{generated/yearly_changes_r_squared_percentage_value.tex} explained variance) and a $p$-value of \input{generated/yearly_changes_p_value.tex}. These values indicate that the apparent connection in the original data does not persist when examining year-over-year trends, further supporting the spurious nature of the correlation.

\begin{section}{Discussion}
 Several hypotheses could explain this correlation:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item Pursuing a Master's degree in Mathematics and Statistics induces migraines.
   \item Sufferers of migraines seek solace in rigorous mathematical study.
   \item This is all an elaborate prank by the universe.
 \end{itemize}
 Clearly, none of these should be taken seriously. Except maybe the last one.
\end{section}

\begin{section}{Conclusion}
 Is this correlation real? Yes. Is it meaningful? No. Should you change careers or question your reality because of it? Absolutely. But more than anything, remember: correlation is not causationâ€”but it sure is fun.
